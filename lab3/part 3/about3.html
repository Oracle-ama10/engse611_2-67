        <p>On this final page, let me rant about the games I play. Hoyoverse games often give you hope only to crush it with off-rate gacha pulls. It’s demoralizing, but when luck strikes, the joy is unmatched. These games truly add color to my life.
        Currently, I’m juggling 33 games daily, clearing quests in each. It’s insane, and I don’t know how I’ve managed this for six years. Many games I loved have shut down, leaving me a bit heartbroken, but I’ve scaled back recently to maintain balance in life.
        Lastly, for those who’ve read this far, I respect you deeply. You’ve endured my rants. Hats off to you!</p>
