        <p>The second game is Genshin Impact, an open-world game. I remember downloading it on the first day and my phone almost exploded from playing it daily. Despite that, it’s a great game and an evolution from Honkai Impact 3 into an open-world format, capable of taking up hours of your life.
        Although I’ve taken breaks, I still play it today. The third game, Honkai Star Rail, is a turn-based game with unique mechanics like exploring the world and engaging in battles. It was refreshing and new for me back then. Lastly, Zenless Zone Zero is a newer action game with similarities to Honkai Impact 3 but with distinct features like parry mechanics. It’s an impressive game!</p>
        <p>Though I enjoy these games, I have to admit Hoyoverse’s gacha rates are frustrating. Getting off-rate pulls can be demoralizing, but the rare lucky pulls always bring a smile.</p>
