        <p>Hello everyone! On this first page, I want to share the games I'm currently playing and a brief description of each. The first game series I'll talk about is from Hoyoverse, a Chinese game company that started with a 2D game called GGZ and evolved into globally popular games like Honkai Impact 3, Genshin Impact, Honkai Star Rail, and Zenless Zone Zero.</p>
        <p>The first game, Honkai Impact 3, is an action gacha game that I started playing as a kid. It was incredibly fun, especially the thrill of pulling characters, building teams, and dealing millions of damage. To this day, I still enjoy playing it.</p>
